# TestsSUI

Hello everyone, my young programmers 😁

I collect new technologies by SwiftUI into one collection.

Plans:

1) New technologies from Apple and their analysis
2) Async / Await with a few examples
3) New libraries
4) Cool animations with different transitions...

Thank you for saving my repository 🥰
